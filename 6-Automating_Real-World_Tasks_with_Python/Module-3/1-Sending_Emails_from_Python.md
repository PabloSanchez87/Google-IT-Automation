# Sending Emails form Python

## Introduction
We'll look into a different aspect of automation: automating the generation of nicely formatted output from our scripts, like sending emails.

Most of us use email for a bunch of different things, all the time. We type up an email message, sometimes  attach a picture or a document, and send it to someone in our contact list. Have you ever used a script to send an email? By the end of this module, youâ€™ll be able to send an email message with an attachment from Python! You'll even learn how to generate PDF files to attach to those emails.

To help with that, we'll look into a bunch of different Python modules that already include a lot of the functionalities that we want. As we've called out, this is one of the great things about Python -- we can use these modules to accomplish what we want with very little code!
