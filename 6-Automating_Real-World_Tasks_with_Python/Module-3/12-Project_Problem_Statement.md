# Project Problem Statement

We'll have to process information related to the sales your company generated last month, and turn that into a nicely formatted PDF report that you'll then send by email so that your boss can look at it. The lab machine has email configured so that you can check your resulting emails through a nice webmail interface that's already up and running.

The system that you'll work with already includes some scripts that will do part of the work for you. You'll need to put these pieces together to get the result you want, basing your code on the one that's already there.

## Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by email

You worked for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wanted to get a summary of the number of vehicles that had been sold at the end of every month. The company already had a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wanted an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.

### What youâ€™ll do
- Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories

- Generate a PDF using Python

- Automatically send a PDF by email
