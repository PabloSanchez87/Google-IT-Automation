# Choosing Between Bash and Python

### Bash Script for Capitalizing Words
```bash
for i in $(cat story.txt); do  # Loop through each word in the file "story.txt"
    B=`echo -n "${i:0:1}" | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]"`  # Convert the first character of each word to uppercase
    echo -n "$B${i:1} "  # Print the word with the capitalized first character, followed by a space
done
```

#### Explanation
This code snippet is written in the Bash scripting language and is designed to capitalize the first letter of each word in a text file (`story.txt`). It iterates through each word, converts the first letter to uppercase using `tr`, and prints the modified word.

### Python Script for Capitalizing Words
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3  # Use Python 3 for running the script
import sys  # Import the sys module to read from standard input

for line in sys.stdin:  # Read each line from standard input
    words = line.strip().split()  # Remove surrounding whitespace and split the line into words
    print(" ".join([word.capitalize() for word in words]))  # Capitalize each word and join them with a space
```

### Explanation
This Python script reads input from a text file or another command, splits it into separate words, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and prints the modified text to standard output. This approach is more concise and easier to read compared to the Bash version.

#### Command to run the script
```bash
cat story.txt | ./capitalize_words.py  # Use `cat` to read the file and pass it to the Python script
```

#### Code Output:
```
Once Upon A Time There Was An Egg Of A Programming Language Called Python

### Choosing Between Bash and Python
- **Bash**: Best for simple text processing tasks, file manipulations, and when working directly with the shell environment.
- **Python**: Preferred for more complex logic, data manipulation, and when readability and maintainability are priorities.

### Conclusion
This comparison shows how both languages can be used to accomplish similar tasks. The choice between Bash and Python depends on the complexity of the task and the developerâ€™s preference.

**Note**: Make sure both scripts have executable permissions before running them:
```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
chmod +x script_name.py
```
