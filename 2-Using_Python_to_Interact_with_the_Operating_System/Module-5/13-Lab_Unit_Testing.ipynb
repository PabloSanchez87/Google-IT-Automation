    "Imagine one of your IT coworkers just retired and left a folder of scripts for you to use. One of the scripts, called `emails.py`, matches users to an email address and lets us easily look them up! For the most part, the script works great â€” you enter in an employee's name and their email is printed to the screen. But, for some employees, the output doesn't look quite right. Your job is to add a test to reproduce the bug, make the necessary corrections, and verify that all the tests pass to make sure the script works! Best of luck!"

    "A try statement may have more than one except clause to specify handlers for different exceptions. In our case, the exception error we need to handle is IndexError.\n",

    "We will add the complete code block within the function find_email(argv), which is within the try block, and add an IndexError exception within the except block. This means that the execution will start normally with any number of parameters given to the script. If the function find_email(argv) receives the required number of parameters, it will return the email address. And if the function doesn't receive the required number of parameters, it will throw an IndexError exception and the except clause which handles IndexError exception would then execute.\n",
