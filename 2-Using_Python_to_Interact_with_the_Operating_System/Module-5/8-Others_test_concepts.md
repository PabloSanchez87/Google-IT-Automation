# Software Testing Approaches and Techniques

In software development, testing plays a critical role in ensuring the functionality and reliability of applications. Various approaches and techniques can be employed depending on the stage of development and the nature of the software being tested.

## 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative approach where tests are written before the code. The idea is to write tests that define the behavior or features of the application, and then write the minimum amount of code required to pass those tests. Once the tests pass, you can continue improving the code.

### TDD Process
1. **Write a test:** Define a test that checks for a specific functionality.
2. **Run the test:** The test should fail initially, as the code has not been written yet.
3. **Write the code:** Write the code to satisfy the test.
4. **Re-run the test:** Ensure the test passes. If it doesnâ€™t, debug the code and run the test again.
5. **Refactor the code:** Improve and optimize your code while ensuring all tests still pass.

**Example:**

```python
# Test: Check if a function returns the sum of two numbers
def test_sum():
    assert sum(1, 2) == 3
```

```python
# Code to pass the test
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
```

## 2. Unit Testing
Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions of a program in isolation. These tests ensure that the smallest parts of the program work as expected.

- **White-Box Testing:** The tester has knowledge of the internal structure of the program and writes tests that cover specific code paths.
- **Black-Box Testing:** The tester focuses on the functionality, without knowing how the code works internally.

**Example:**

```python
# Testing a calculator's add function
def test_add():
    assert calculator.add(2, 3) == 5
```

## 3. Integration Testing
Integration testing is done to verify that different modules or components of a system work together as expected. It ensures that the interaction between systems, such as APIs, databases, or third-party services, behaves correctly.

**Example:**

```python
# Testing if the database connection works when adding a new user
def test_user_creation():
    response = database.create_user("test_user")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

## 4. Smoke Testing
Smoke tests, or build verification tests, ensure that the basic functionality of a program works. These tests are usually quick checks to verify that the system is not broken after a new build or deployment.

**Example:**
```bash
# Running a smoke test on a web application
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health_check
```

## 5. Regression Testing
Regression tests ensure that previously working features continue to work after new changes are introduced. These tests help catch bugs that may have been reintroduced into the codebase.

**Example:**

```python
# Regression test for a fixed bug in user authentication
def test_user_login():
    response = auth_service.login("test_user", "password123")
    assert response == "Login successful"
```

## 6. Load Testing
Load testing evaluates how the system behaves under heavy traffic or usage. This helps ensure the system can handle expected loads and perform within acceptable limits.

**Example:**
```bash
# Simulating 1000 concurrent users on a web application
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://example.com/
```

By combining these testing techniques, we can build robust test suites that cover various aspects of functionality and reliability.
