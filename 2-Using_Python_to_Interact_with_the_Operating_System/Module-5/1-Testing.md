# Software Testing Concepts
The process of evaluating computer code to determinate whether or not it does what it is supposed to do.

## 1. Introduction to Python Testing
- **Manual testing**: Running code manually to verify functionality.
- **Automatic testing**: Focus of this module, automating checks to save time and improve reliability.

## 2. Importance of Software Testing
- **Simple code**: Easy to verify manually (e.g., adding two variables).
- **Complex code**: Loops, conditionals, multiple functions require more thorough testing.
- **Analogy**: Testing software is like testing machinery, e.g., testing a car to ensure it functions properly.

## 3. Manual vs. Automatic Testing
- **Manual testing**:
  - Running scripts with different parameters.
  - Using the interpreter to try code before scripting.
  - Example: Testing a script that updates email addresses with various inputs.
- **Automatic testing**:
  - Code is tested with various test cases automatically.
  - Ensures consistency and catches bugs before production.
  - Example: Testing behavior with a list of emails of varying lengths and formats.

## 4. Unit Testing
- **Definition**: Testing individual units of code in isolation.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Allows running multiple test cases automatically.
  - Raises errors when code doesn't behave as expected.
- **Purpose**: Ensures code reliability as it evolves.

## 5. Types of Testing Covered
- **Unit testing**: Focus of this module.
- **Other types**:
  - Integration testing.
  - Test-driven development (TDD).
- **Goal**: Provide foundational knowledge for writing reliable automated tests.
