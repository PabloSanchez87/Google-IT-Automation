    "# Lab: Searching Log Files for Errors with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Imagine one of your colleagues is struggling with a program that keeps throwing an error. Unfortunately, the program's source code is too complicated to easily find the error there. The good news is that the program outputs a log file you can read! Let's write a script to search the log file for the exact error, then output that error into a separate file so you can work out what's wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll do\n",
    "1. Write a script to search the log file using regex to find the exact error.\n",
    "2. Report the error into a separate file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Complete the Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Viewing the Log File\n",
    "In the `/data` directory, there's a file named `fishy.log`, which contains the system log. Each log entry is written in this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Month Day hour:minute:second mycomputername \"process_name\"[\"random 5 digit number\"] \"ERROR/INFO/WARN\" \"Error description\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the log file, use the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat ~/data/fishy.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "July 31 00:06:21 mycomputername kernel[96041]: WARN Failed to start network connection\n",
    "July 31 00:09:53 mycomputername updater[46711]: WARN Computer needs to be turned off and on again\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Creating the Script\n",
    "We will now create a Python script named `find_error.py` in the `scripts` directory. Start by navigating to the directory and creating the file using `nano`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/scripts\n",
    "nano find_error.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Writing the Script\n",
    "Add the shebang line and import the necessary Python modules:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Defining the `error_search` Function\n",
    "The function `error_search` takes a log file as a parameter and prompts the user for the error to search. It uses regular expressions to find any errors in the log file that match the user's input. Here's how you can define it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def error_search(log_file):\n",
    "    error = input(\"What is the error? \")\n",
    "    returned_errors = []\n",
    "    with open(log_file, mode='r', encoding='UTF-8') as file:\n",
    "        for log in file.readlines():\n",
    "            error_patterns = [\"error\"]\n",
    "            for i in range(len(error.split(' '))):\n",
    "                error_patterns.append(r\"{}\".format(error.split(' ')[i].lower()))\n",
    "            if all(re.search(error_pattern, log.lower()) for error_pattern in error_patterns):\n",
    "                returned_errors.append(log)\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "    return returned_errors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Defining the `file_output` Function\n",
    "Now, create the function `file_output`, which writes the found errors to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def file_output(returned_errors):\n",
    "    with open(os.path.expanduser('~') + '/data/errors_found.log', 'w') as file:\n",
    "        for error in returned_errors:\n",
    "            file.write(error)\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Writing the Main Block\n",
    "The main block calls both functions and runs the script:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    log_file = sys.argv[1]\n",
    "    returned_errors = error_search(log_file)\n",
    "    file_output(returned_errors)\n",
    "    sys.exit(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Making the Script Executable and Running It\n",
    "Save the file, and then make it executable with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo chmod +x find_error.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, run the script and pass the `fishy.log` file as a parameter:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./find_error.py ~/data/fishy.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When prompted, enter the type of error to search:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "CRON ERROR Failed to start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Viewing the Output\n",
    "After running the script, check the generated `errors_found.log` file with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat ~/data/errors_found.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will show all log entries matching the search criteria:\n",
    "```\n",
    "July 31 04:11:32 mycomputername CRON[51253]: ERROR: Failed to start CRON job due to script syntax error. Inform the CRON job owner!\n",
    "```\n"
