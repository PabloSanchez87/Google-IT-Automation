# Is it worth the time?

Think about a task or process you’ve completed at work time and time again. Have you ever thought that there has to be a more efficient way to execute this routine task or process? Chances are—you’re right. Companies research whether automating processes or tasks saves labor time (and thus money), offers a soft return on investment (ROI), or both. If it’s worth it, the automated process will save labor time for the company, soft ROI benefits, or both.

## Soft ROI

Soft ROI through automation is difficult to measure because, typically, there are no hard numbers or data to support it. Soft ROI metrics include improving:

- Team collaboration
- Team morale
- Employee motivation
- Employee satisfaction

Think back to the task or process you complete weekly, or even daily. If this task was automated—as an employee—you would be less likely to be bored and, in return, be more motivated to complete other tasks that are not rote, creating high morale in the workplace.

## Is automation worthwhile?

To determine if automating a process would save labor time, use the following formula:

```
Time_to_automate < (time_to_perform * amount_of_times_done)
```

Let’s break down this formula and look at an example:

A banking company is looking to automate one of its internal processes that takes about 40 minutes each week to complete. The automation process will take 10 hours total to complete. How many weeks will it be before the banking company begins to save time on the process and automation would be worthwhile?

- **time_to_automate** = 10 hours
- **time_to_perform** = 40 minutes
- **amount_of_times_done** = x

**Pro tip:** Notice that you have two measurements of time. Before plugging values into the formula, convert 10 hours to minutes.

Multiply 10 by 60 to convert 10 hours into minutes. You get 600 minutes.

When you plug your values into the formula from above, you get:

```
600 < 40x
```

**Pro tip:** `x` represents the number of weeks, so you can replace that with `x` in the formula.

Then, divide both sides by 40 to get:

```
15 < weeks
```

It will take 15 weeks before the banking company starts saving time on the process. Remember, automating this process only needs to occur once. In addition, it helps employees by removing the need to think about the task and keeping up with the tracking of it.

## Key takeaways

Companies must decide whether it is worth the time, effort, and money to automate certain processes that are commonly used. To do this, calculate the ROI to determine if investing in workflow automation is beneficial to the company and its employees.
