# Glossary terms, module 3

**Break:** A way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false

**Control statements:** Programming constructs that direct the flow of execution of a program by allowing you to make decisions, repeat actions, or choose between different code paths based on specific conditions.

**For loop:** This executes a block of code for a specified number of iterations or over a collection of items.

**Infinite loop:** A sequence that is missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever

**Iterators:** Variables that allow you to loop through a collection one item at a time

**Loop:** A sequence that makes the computer do repetitive tasks 

**Programming:** The process of writing a program to behave in different ways 

**Pass:** A placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement, but you don't want to execute any code or command

**Recursion:** The repeated application of the same procedure to a smaller problem

**While loop:** This is used when a segment of code needs to execute repeatedly while a condition is true
