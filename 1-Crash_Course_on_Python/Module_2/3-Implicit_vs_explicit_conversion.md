# Implicit vs explicit conversion

Some data types can be mixed and matched due to implicit conversion. Implicit conversion occurs when the interpreter automatically converts one data type into another without needing explicit instructions.

In contrast, explicit conversion is when we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. For example, when we want to print a number alongside some text, we first need to call the str() function to convert the number into a string. Once the number is explicitly converted to a string, we can join it with the rest of our text and print the result.
