# Use JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

There are many different places and environments that you can use to write and run code. 

JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks are part of an open source project called 
[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and are free to use. 

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a web-based interface that allows you to use Jupyter Notebooks to write, run, and debug Python code. JupyterLab is an online environment that allows you to run your code in the cloud. 

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook can be used and run in the web-based interface through 
[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) or on your local machine. 

Jupyter Notebook allows you to create documents that contain live code. You can write Python programs and scripts using Jupyter Notebooks and see how they execute all in one place. It is a great tool for creating and understanding the code you are writing because you can see your input and output all in one spot.
