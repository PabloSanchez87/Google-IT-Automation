# Lists Defined

In Python, lists are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: `my_list = ["This", "is", "a", "list"]`. You can use the `len()` function to return the number of elements in a list: `len(my_list)` would return `4`. You can also use the `in` keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a `True` boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return `False`. For example, `"This" in my_list` would return `True` in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing `my_list[0]`, which would allow you to access the string `"This"`.

In Python, lists and strings are quite similar. Theyâ€™re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, such as:
1. Being able to iterate over them using `for` loops.
2. Supporting indexing.
3. Using the `len` function to find the length of the sequence.
4. Using the `+` operator to concatenate.
5. Using the `in` keyword to check if the sequence contains a value.

Understanding these concepts allows you to apply them to other sequence types as well.
