# Dictionaries Defined
Dictionaries are another data structure in Python. They’re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. However, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Data in a dictionary is organized into pairs of keys and values. You use the key to access the corresponding value. Where a list index is always a number, a dictionary key can be a different data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples.

When creating a dictionary, you use curly brackets: `{}`. When storing values in a dictionary, the key is specified first, followed by the corresponding value, separated by a colon. For example, `animals = { "bears":10, "lions":1, "tigers":2 }` creates a dictionary with three key-value pairs, stored in the variable `animals`. The key `"bears"` points to the integer value `10`, while the key `"lions"` points to the integer value `1`, and `"tigers"` points to the integer `2`. You can access the values by referencing the key, like this: `animals["bears"]`. This would return the integer `10`, since that’s the corresponding value for this key.

You can also check if a key is contained in a dictionary using the `in` keyword. Just like other uses of this keyword, it will return `True` if the key is found in the dictionary; otherwise, it will return `False`.

Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary, similar to lists. You can add a new key-value pair to a dictionary by assigning a value to the key, like this: `animals["zebras"] = 2`. This creates the new key in the `animals` dictionary called `"zebras"`, and stores the value `2`. You can modify the value of an existing key by doing the same thing. So `animals["bears"] = 11` would change the value stored in the `"bears"` key from `10` to `11`. Lastly, you can remove elements from a dictionary by using the `del` keyword. By doing `del animals["lions"]` you would remove the key-value pair from the `animals` dictionary.
