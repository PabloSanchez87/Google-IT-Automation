It can be easy to become overwhelmed with all that needs done every day, especially when you’re struggling to fix programming issues and manage other deadlines. How do you prioritize your workload when you’re busy? Here are some tips!

## Make a list

Lists can be invaluable for many important things in our work: planning a project, revising a program, or keeping track of our project to-do lists. They can help us organize tasks for a given day, week, or month. They also help us sort out individual items to make them more manageable and remember the smaller things that need done in between.

Perhaps the most important thing when you’re feeling like everything needs done today is to create a list for yourself: Write down everything you feel like you need to do. Include work priorities, such as upcoming key deadlines, day-to-day tasks, and longer-term goals.

You can use a piece of paper, task-management software, a document, or whatever works best for you. The key here is just to get them listed out in a central place. Try to catch all the things that ping your brain through the course of any given day.

## Organize

Next, take a closer look at your list: Which items are longer-term items, such as months out? Which items are weekly? Then, which items are daily? Sorting items by timeframe will help you see them in a more manageable way.

Look also for ways to break projects down into smaller tasks. For example, it can feel overwhelming to think about redesigning your company’s network to reduce latency and traffic. Instead, you can break this big project into smaller tasks such as redesigning only one subnet at a time.

## Prioritize

Now, you’ll want to sort your list to prioritize your tasks. One useful tool is to label each to-do by urgency and importance. Think of important items as those that will give you a sense of accomplishment when they’re complete, and urgent items as tasks that require your immediate attention. Things on your list can be both, neither, or either. For example, defining your goals for the next quarter may be important, but possibly not urgent. Fixing code that keeps an application from functioning is likely urgent and importa...

## Schedule

Finally, set yourself goals for each day: Either the night before or the first thing each morning, create a list of things you need to complete, sorted by urgency and importance. Try to limit it to a manageable number; ideally ten tasks or fewer. Put the more urgent and important priorities at the top of the list, and then rank the rest accordingly. This will give you an organized starting point for the day.

## Tips

Consider your personality: Are you most productive later in the afternoon? Schedule your highest urgency and importance items in those time frames, and perhaps work on your more important but less urgent items in the morning. Can you think about your goals for the next quarter while you’re having your morning coffee? Maybe try setting an hour at some point in your day to respond to important (but not urgent) messages and emails instead of immediately as they come in?

Be creative, but realistic. **Do not** overschedule your day. Remember: By including both urgent and important tasks throughout your day, you’ll feel good about not just tackling the things that have to be done, but also those that give you a sense of accomplishment.

Emergencies and unexpected events will arise—they always do. When that happens, re-evaluate your list for the day or week, and then see what you shuffle. This is where the urgent and important come into play: Can you delay working on your quarterly goals until tomorrow? Can you reply to a colleague’s email in the morning? Can you delegate a meeting to another team member? Consider those items and reform your tomorrow/weekly/monthly list accordingly.

## Key takeaway

By taking a structured approach to your day-to-day and long-term tasks, you can better manage your time and mental energy and stay focused on what matters most.
