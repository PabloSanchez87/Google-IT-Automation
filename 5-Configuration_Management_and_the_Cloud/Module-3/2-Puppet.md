# Puppet

## About this code
This block of code is saying that the package 'sudo' should be present on every computer where the rule gets applied. If this rule is applied on 100 computers, it would automatically install the package in all of them. This is a small and simple block but can already give us a basic impression of how rules are written in puppet.
```puppet
class sudo {
 
  package { 'sudo':
    ensure => present,
  }
}
```

## About this code
Here a file resource is defined. This is used for managing files and directories. This block of code ensures that  /etc/sysctl.d exists and is a directory.

```puppet
class sysctl {
  # Make sure the directory exists, some distros don't have it
  file { '/etc/sysctl.d':
    ensure => directory,
  }
}
```

## About this code
In this code block, we are configuring the contents of /etc/timezone. This will be a file, and the contents of the file will be set to the UTC timezone. We also set the replace attribute to true, which means that even if the contents of the file already exist, they will  be replaced.  

```puppet	
class timezone {
      file { '/etc/timezone':
        ensure  => file,
        content => "UTC\n",
        replace => true,
      }
}s
```

## About this code
This code block includes a class with three resources, a package, a file, and a service. All of them are related to the Network Time Protocol, or NTP, the mechanism our computers use to synchronize the clocks. This code ensures that the NTP package is always upgraded to the latest version. We're setting the contents of the configuration file using the source attribute, which means that the agent will read the required contents from the specified location. And we're saying that we want the NTP service to be enabled and running. By grouping all of the resources related to NTP in the same class, we only need a quick glance to understand how the service is configured and how it's supposed to work. This would make it easier to make changes in the future since we have all the related resources together. It makes sense to use this technique whenever we want to group related resources. 

```puppet
class ntp {
  package { 'ntp':
    ensure => latest,
  }
  file { '/etc/ntp.conf':
    source => 'puppet:///modules/ntp/ntp.conf'
    replace => true,
  }
  service { 'ntp':
    enable  => true,
    ensure  => running,
  }
}
```
